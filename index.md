## What is Kaizen Code Dojo?

We meet once a month to work on coding katas. In martial arts, a kata is a short exercise designed to hone a specific motion through repetition, generating muscle memory. Software developers have borrowed the concept of repetition in order to hone our development skills, so that we can write clearer, cleaner code.
